## Practice-based Research in Japanese Subculture and ACG Culture

My research on Japanese subculture and ACG (Animation, Comics, Games) culture is grounded not only in textual and theoretical analysis, but also in sustained practice-based research. I conceptualize creative and cultural practices not as supplementary interests, but as methodological sites through which cultural meanings, identities, and affective relations are produced, negotiated, and embodied.

Through embodied, performative, and platform-mediated practices, this research examines how Japanese ACG culture is lived, reproduced, and recontextualized across transnational and digital environments, particularly within contemporary youth, Generation Z, and fandom cultures.

## Platform-based Performative Practice: V-Tuber

V-Tuber culture—originally conceptualized as <strong>Vチューバー（V-Tuber）</strong>—emerged from native content practices on the Japanese platform NicoNico and constitutes an important subcultural branch within Japanese ACG culture. My practice-based research engages with this cultural form through sustained V-Tuber activity on the Chinese video-sharing platform Bilibili, situating Japanese-originated virtual performance within a transnational platform environment.

This practice involves participation across the full production process of a V-Tuber persona, including original character concept development, visual design through sketches and illustration, Live2D model production, and the practical application of V-Tuber software. Through this end-to-end engagement, I examine how virtual identities are constructed, mediated, and sustained within contemporary ACG-related platform cultures.

Within this context, I deliberately adopt the Japanese subcultural performance genre known as <em><strong>歌ってみた</strong></em> (utatte-mita, “singing covers”), a well-established expressive form within NicoNico and broader Japanese ACG culture. Rather than treating anime song performance as an independent musical activity, <em>歌ってみた</em> is analyzed here as an affective and participatory mode embedded within V-Tuber culture, enabling a deeper practice-based engagement with Japanese ACG aesthetics, collective memory, and fandom practices.

## Cosplay as Embodied Research Practice

In contrast to platform-based virtual practice, my research also incorporates cosplay—<strong>コスプレ（Cosplay）</strong>—as an embodied and materially grounded research practice. Rather than focusing on public performance or event participation, cosplay is approached here as a mode of embodied interpretation through which fictional ACG characters are translated into bodily presence, visual form, and affective stance.

Through costume-making, character visualization, and embodied experimentation, cosplay functions as a practice-based method for reflecting on character design, visual semiotics, and the relationship between media texts and physical bodies within Japanese ACG culture. These visual materials are treated as research documentation that supports analytical reflection on embodiment, imagination, and fan creativity.

Within Japanese ACG and cosplay cultures, real-world gender is often de-emphasized or rendered secondary to character-based identification. As a result, cosplay practices are generally not constrained by the cosplayer’s biological or social gender. Grounded in a shared affection for Japanese ACG culture and a strong sense of fandom-based identification, cosplay participants frequently suspend their “three-dimensional” (real-world) identity markers and engage with one another primarily within the “two-dimensional” cultural imaginary. Through this process, cosplay contributes to the formation of distinctive <em>subcultural social networks (circle layers)</em>, in which mutual recognition is structured around characters, aesthetics, and shared cultural knowledge rather than real-world demographic attributes.

## Synthesis

Taken together, platform-based V-Tuber practice and embodied cosplay practice constitute a multi-modal framework of practice-based research into contemporary Japanese ACG culture. Situated within the broader context of Generation Z, subcultural fandoms, and participatory fan communities, this research foregrounds how cultural identities and group affiliations are formed through embodied, affective, and mediated practices.

By examining both virtual and physical modes of participation, this approach highlights the ways in which Japanese ACG culture operates as a lived and practiced cultural system, shaping subcultural belonging, creative labor, and identity formation within transnational youth and fandom cultures.
