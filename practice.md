## Practice-based Research in Japanese Subculture and ACG Culture

My research on Japanese subculture and ACG (Animation, Comics, Games) culture is grounded not only in textual and theoretical analysis, but also in sustained practice-based research. I employ embodied, performative, and platform-mediated cultural practices as methodological tools to examine how Japanese ACG culture is experienced, reproduced, and recontextualized across transnational contexts.

Rather than positioning creative practices as supplementary or personal interests, I conceptualize them as methodological sites through which cultural meanings, identities, and affective relations are enacted and negotiated. In this sense, practice functions as both an object of analysis and a mode of inquiry.

## Platform-based Performative Practice: V-Tuber and Anime Song Performance

My practice-based research first engages with platform-mediated performative practices situated within digital media environments. I conduct sustained activity as a virtual streamer (V-Tuber) on the Chinese video-sharing platform Bilibili, where virtual embodiment, real-time audience interaction, and platform mediation constitute key dimensions of cultural practice.

In addition to visual and interactive performance, my platform-based practice includes the performance and production of Japanese anime song covers. These vocal performances function as an affective and auditory mode of participation within ACG culture, complementing visual forms of virtual embodiment and extending the analysis of fan creativity, memory, and emotional circulation.

## Cosplay as Embodied Research Practice

Alongside platform-based practice, my research also incorporates cosplay as a form of embodied and offline research practice. Rather than treating cosplay as a hobby or auxiliary activity, I conceptualize it as a methodological approach through which fictional characters are materially embodied, interpreted, and performed.

Through costume production, character embodiment, performative posture, and participation in fan events, cosplay enables an examination of identity performance, gender expression, fan labor, and affective engagement within Japanese subcultural spaces. This embodied engagement provides insight into how ACG characters operate as cultural interfaces between media texts, bodies, and audiences.

## Synthesis

Taken together, platform-based performative practice (V-Tuber and anime song performance) and embodied offline practice (cosplay) constitute a multi-modal framework of practice-based research. By moving between virtual embodiment, affective performance, and physical embodiment, this approach foregrounds the body, performance, and creative labor as central analytical sites in the study of contemporary Japanese subculture and ACG culture.
