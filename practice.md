## Practice-based Research in Japanese Subculture and ACG Culture

My research on Japanese subculture and ACG (Animation, Comics, Games) culture is grounded not only in textual and theoretical analysis, but also in sustained practice-based research. I employ embodied, performative, and platform-mediated cultural practices as methodological tools to examine how Japanese ACG culture is experienced, reproduced, and recontextualized across transnational contexts.

Cosplay constitutes a core component of this practice-based approach. Rather than treating cosplay as a hobby or auxiliary activity, I conceptualize it as an embodied research practice through which fictional characters are materialized, interpreted, and performed. Through costume production, character embodiment, performative posture, and participation in fan events, cosplay enables an examination of identity performance, gender expression, fan labor, and affective engagement within Japanese subcultural spaces. This embodied engagement provides insights into how ACG characters function as cultural interfaces between media texts, bodies, and audiences.

This embodied practice is further integrated with my research on digital and platform cultures through sustained activity as a virtual streamer (V-Tuber) on the Chinese video-sharing platform Bilibili:

The content produced on this platform primarily revolves around Japanese ACG culture, including animation- and game-related discussions, virtual performance, and audience interaction. This platform-based practice enables the observation of participatory culture, affective engagement, and community formation within contemporary ACG fandoms.

In addition, my practice-based research includes the performance and production of Japanese anime song covers, which function as an affective and auditory mode of cultural participation within ACG culture. Anime song performance complements visual embodiment practices and extends the analysis of fan creativity, performativity, and transmedia circulation.

Together, cosplay, virtual streaming, and anime song performance form a coherent practice-based research framework that connects embodiment, performance, and platform circulation. This integrated approach enables a multi-layered understanding of Japanese ACG culture as a lived, practiced, and transnational phenomenon, bridging offline fan practices and online digital platforms. Through this methodology, my research foregrounds the role of the body, performance, and creative labor as central analytical sites in the study of contemporary Japanese subculture.
