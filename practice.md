## Practice-based Research in Japanese Subculture and ACG Culture

My research on Japanese subculture and ACG (Animation, Comics, Games) culture is grounded not only in textual and theoretical analysis, but also in sustained practice-based research. I employ embodied, performative, and platform-mediated cultural practices as methodological tools to examine how Japanese ACG culture is experienced, reproduced, and recontextualized across transnational contexts.

Cosplay constitutes a core component of this practice-based approach. Rather than treating cosplay as a hobby or auxiliary activity, I conceptualize it as an embodied research practice through which fictional characters are materialized, interpreted, and performed. Through costume production, character embodiment, performative posture, and participation in fan events, cosplay enables an examination of identity performance, gender expression, fan labor, and affective engagement within Japanese subcultural spaces. This embodied engagement provides insights into how ACG characters function as cultural interfaces between media texts, bodies, and audiences.

This embodied practice is further integrated with my research on digital and platform cultures through sustained activity as a virtual streamer (V-Tuber) on the Chinese video-sharing platform Bilibili.
